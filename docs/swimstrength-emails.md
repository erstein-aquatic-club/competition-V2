### 20 hours got me nowhere

Hey François,
 
I trained 20+ hours a week in college. Three years. Same times.
 
Know what I was doing wrong?
 
Trying to improve everything at once. Endurance, speed, strength, technique. All pulling in different directions.
 
I got better at training. Not better at racing.
 
Then I quit. Came back later. Trained 3 hours per week total. Just focused on strength and top speed.
 
Went all my PBs. Overweight and out of shape.
 
The difference? I only worked on my biggest limiting factor. Everything else improved as a side effect.
 
That's what happens when you stop spreading yourself thin.

### The kink in the hose

Hey François,
 
When you start focusing on your biggest limiting factor, things might feel worse before they get better.
 
You're doing less overall volume. You're not working on everything at once anymore.
 
It feels wrong. Like you're missing something.
 
You're not.
 
You're just fixing the kink in the hose instead of trying to push more water through it.
 
Give it a few weeks. Things will start clicking. Your times will improve. You'll feel better.
 
But you have to push through that awkward phase when your brain is screaming "this isn't enough."
 
It is enough. Trust it.

### Three buckets only

Hey François,
 
Joint health. Strength and speed. Mobility.
 
These are your biggest limiting factors.
 
Fix these and everything else in your swimming improves automatically. Your technique. Your endurance. Your confidence.
 
But also: Your energy. Your mood. Your sleep. Your patience.
 
Because getting physically stronger makes your nervous system more efficient. And that nervous system runs everything in your body.
 
Digestion. Sleep. Pain management. All of it.
 
Two to three 30-45 minute sessions per week. That's all it takes to fix these three things.
 
Best time you'll spend all week.
 
Jake

### Stretching lies

Hey François,
 
Flexibility alone doesn't help you in the pool.
 
If someone can pull your arm into a position but you can't get there yourself, you're not going to use that range in swimming.
 
That's passive mobility. Not that helpful in the pool.
 
You need active mobility. That means strength in those end ranges.
 
This is why stretching feels good but doesn't give you long-term results. You're opening up the range but not building the strength to use it.
 
Our mobility work is intense. It has a strength component. It actually forces adaptation.
 
Not just feel-good stretching. Real work.

### No drills will save you

Hey François,
 
People ask me for butterfly tips and drills all the time.
 
Here's the truth: If you can't swim butterfly, you're not strong enough.
 
That's it.
 
You need to be able to launch your body over the surface of the water. If your arms and core aren't strong enough to do that, no drill will help.
 
Get stronger overall. Butterfly gets easier.
 
Same goes for every stroke. If you're weak, swimming is just harder. Simple as that.
 
Stop looking for technique fixes. Get strong first.

### Strength fixes endurance

Hey François,
 
Getting stronger doesn't just make you stronger.
 
It improves your mobility. Your technique. Your endurance. Your speed.
 
Example: Two swimmers racing a 200. One has a 25-second 50 PB. The other has a 30-second 50 PB.
 
Who's faster at the 200?
 
The 25-second swimmer. Easily.
 
Because holding 30 seconds per 50 is sub-maximal for them. For the other swimmer, it's their absolute max.
 
Faster top speed = easier everything else.
 
Stronger = lighter everything else.
 
This is why strength isn't just about strength. It's the tide that lifts all boats.

### easiest motivation hack

Hey François,
 
If you're not tracking your weights, you're guessing.
 
Guessing leads to thinking you're not making progress. So you do more. Then you can't recover. Then you plateau. Then you try something new.
 
The cycle never ends.
 
Track important stuff. Every session.
 
Those tiny wins - 0.5kg heavier, one extra rep, slightly bigger range of motion - they add up.
 
When you see progress, you want to keep showing up.
 
And if something's not working, you'll know. You can fix it based on data, not feelings.

### training to failure isn't necessary

Hey François,
 
Going to failure doesn't make you stronger.
 
Research shows this.
 
My experience over the last 10 years shows this.
 
Stop your set at 7-8 out of 10. Leave 2-3 reps in the tank. Do more sets if you really need to.
 
Last rep should be hard but not grinding. You should feel like you could maybe do 2 more.
 
This gets you: Just as strong or stronger. Less soreness. Better recovery. More energy for swimming.
 
Those last reps to failure drain your nervous system for basically nothing.
 
Stop proving how tough you are. Start getting results.

### my actual opinion on push/pull/legs

Hey François,
 
For most swimmers...
 
Stop doing push/pull/leg splits.
 
Here's what happens:
 
Leg day destroys your legs. Next day in the pool you can't kick properly so you overuse your arms. Then push day wrecks your upper body. 
 
Now you're overusing your legs.
 
Your technique keeps changing based on what's sore.
 
Full body training fixes this:
 
Train everything 2-3x per week instead of once. Balanced fatigue. Better quality work. Miss a session? Doesn't matter.
 
You feel better. You swim better. Faster progress.
 
If performance is your priority - full-body sessions is the way to go.

### I quit swimming - then went PBs

Hey François,
 
I swam my whole life. National medals in the UK. Division 1 in the States.
 
And for the second half of my career, I was stuck.
 
Plateaued. Tired. Training up to 30 hours a week. Doing everything I was supposed to do. Getting nowhere.
 
Then I retired.
 
Stopped swimming. Barely touched the pool for years. Got a bit overweight. Definitely out of shape by swimmer standards.
 
But I kept learning. Started figuring out what actually works for strength training. Experimented on myself. Stripped everything back to the basics.
 
Then one day I got back in the pool.
 
And I went PBs.
 
Not just one. Multiple events. Faster than I'd ever been when I was "in shape" and training like a maniac.
 
What the hell?
 
Here's what I figured out:
 
All those years of grinding - it wasn't making me faster.
 
It was just making me tired.
 
I was so overtrained that my body couldn't actually adapt to anything. I was too fatigued to be powerful. Too beat up to move properly. Too locked down to be efficient.
 
When I stripped it all back - minimalist strength training, proper rest, no fluff - my body finally had the space to do what it was capable of.
 
And it turns out I had way more in the tank than I ever realised.
 
This is what I see with swimmers every single day now.
 
You're not lacking talent. You're not lacking work ethic. You're probably not even lacking fitness.
 
You're lacking recovery. You're lacking the right stimulus. You're doing too much of the wrong stuff and not enough of the right stuff.
 
And the right stuff doesn't take much.
 
2-3 gym sessions a week. 45 minutes max. Enough rest to actually reproduce effort and get a little better each week.
 
That's it.
 
We've had swimmers in our memberships go lifetime bests in their 40s and 50s. Kids breaking out of years-long plateaus. Age groupers dropping times they didn't think were possible.
 
Not because they trained harder.
 
Because they finally trained smarter.
 
If you're stuck and nothing's working, this is probably why.
 
Come join us and let's fix it: https://www.swimstrength.co.uk/swimstrengthmembership

### Butterfly tips

Hey François,
 
If butterfly is something you're struggling with or just want to get it feeling better - here are the main things I see people need. 
 
Tight chest - get some push-up isometrics to open up the chest. Different hanging variations can also help. Spending time in these positions will build strength, endurance and mobility through this area to help open up the chest press in the fly stroke.  
Weak in the upper back - you also need a strong upper back if you're going to be able to open up the chest more as well. We like things like push hangs, cable face pulls, cable Ys, etc.  
Spine and hip mobility - opening up the spine can dramatically help shoulders open up too. starting with just some spinal hygiene cna make a huge impact to how your whole body is able to move.  
Try this stuff and let me know if it helps!

### Most swim coaches don't want you to know this

Hey François,
 
The number one reason you're in a plateau as a competitive swimmer trying to go faster?
 
Your coach's ego.
 
Most coaches can't admit their program isn't working for you. So they keep doing what works for their previous genetic freaks. The athletes who can survive anything.
 
And everyone else? Gets overtrained and plateaus.
 
Here's what they won't tell you: you can't change what happens in the pool. But you can completely change what happens outside of it.
 
We get messages almost daily from swimmers who changed nothing in the pool, added our strength work, and broke through plateaus they'd been stuck in for months or years.
 
Same pool program. Same coach. Different result.
 
Because they finally filled the bucket their swimming was draining.
 
You can't control your coach. But you can control what you do outside the pool.

### Microdosing Strength Training

Hey François,
 
When you add something new (more swimming, more paddles, more gym), most people spike stress too fast.
 
That’s how you end up with elbows, shoulders, “random” injuries.
 
What I do instead:
 
Keep the swim steady. Micro-dose the gym.
 
Small sessions, most days:
 
1 hard set of 1-2 lifts.
 
It’s easier to recover from.
 Easier to adjust.
 And you learn what your body actually responds to.
 
Big changes break people.
 Tiny changes, repeated over time, build monsters. The good kind.

### Don't be dense...

Hey François,
 
Lots of swimmers fall into a trap:
 
“Session was dense. I did loads. I got sweaty. So it worked.”
 
No.
 
If you’ve got 30 minutes, doing 15 exercises doesn’t mean you got stronger.
 It usually means you did a bunch of low-intensity work fast.
 
Better option:
 
Do 1-2 bang-for-your-buck lifts. Rest enough. Get stronger.
 
Then add dense accessory work at the end if you want.
 
Stop chasing fatigue.
 Chase strength you can actually use in the water.

### Core Training Mistakes

Hey François,
 
How much core training are you doing?
 
Russian twists, crunches, planks going for the burn. And your core's still a weak link?
 
All that work where you're locking your core down and tightening everything up just so you can feel the burn? That's actually teaching your core to stay locked down. Which reduces your mobility everywhere. Makes you less efficient.
 
And I see this all the time - the people asking me most about how to get their core stronger are the ones doing the most core training.
 
Here's what to do instead:
 
The people with the most efficient technique, the best cores? They don't feel their core. Because their core can relax and allow their body to groove and move through the stroke.
 
If you're so locked down all the time, you can't move properly.
 
Get your core to relax. Then build strength through full range of motion with weight training you can actually progress. Not 300 crunches this week and 300 crunches next week with zero evidence you got any stronger.
 
This is all in our programs in our app.

### 🙁 Sorry - You're not a freak

Hey François,
 
Most swim programs are designed for genetic freaks. Accidentally.
 
Here's how it works:
 
Coach throws massive volume at everyone. Most swimmers break down or plateau.
 
But a few genetic outliers - thosewith insane recovery capacity - survive.
 
Not because the program is good. Despite the program being terrible.
 
Then everyone looks at those freaks and says "that program works" and copies it.
 
Result? Training designed for 1% of swimmers forced on 100% of swimmers.
 
If you're not a genetic freak and you're following traditional stuff, you're likely overtrained and understimulated.
 
Your coach won't change because the freaks make them look good. That feeds their ego.
 
But you can change what you do outside the pool - and that's where we come in.
 
Our minimalist strength programs build the foundation that lets you handle swimming better.
 
We can't fix your swim coach. But we can make YOU more resilient.

### 👨‍⚕️ Most Docs Don't Get This

Hey François,
 
When I had shoulder pain as a competitive swimmer, my physio gave me the classic rotator cuff exercises.
 
3x20 with bands. Internal rotation. External rotation.
 
I did them religiously.
 
The pain got a tiny bit better temporarily but the problem never got sorted properly.
 
Here's what nobody told me:
 
Your shoulder is connected to everything else.
 
Fixing just your rotator cuff while ignoring your:
Shoulder blade mobility 
Rib cage movement 
Thoracic spine 
Hip mobility 
...is like fixing the car engine, but not pumping up your tires.
 
Your shoulder blade needs to glide. Your ribs and t-spine need to actually move.
 
Everything needs to coordinate to get your shoulder in the right postions.
 
I've seen swimmers fix their shoulder pain by working on their HIPS because the whole body is connected.
 
Our mobility programs address the entire system, not just isolated muscles.
 
Rotator cuff work is part of it. But it's not the whole picture.
 
If you've been doing band exercises for months and nothing's changing, you're missing the rest of the chain.

P.s. Ready to fix the whole system? SwimStrength membership gives you complete shoulder, spine, and hip mobility programs.

### 👋 Slipping Water?

Hey François,
 
You're slipping water at the end of races.
 
So you do more technique work. More high elbow drills. More sculling.
 
It's not translating to your races.
 
Here's probably why:
 
Your technique is probably fine when you're going easy.
 
You just don't have the physical capacity to hold that technique when you're fatigued - like you are in a race.
 
Can you get into a good catch position when you're fresh? Yes.
 
Can you hold it at the end of a 200 when your shoulders are burning? No.
 
That's not a technique problem. That's a capacity problem.
 
Most swimmers waste months doing more technique work when what they actually need is the strength and endurance to maintain positions under fatigue.
 
We've built programs specifically for this - building the capacity swimmers actually need in races.
 
Stop practicing perfect technique at 60% and thinking it'll transfer to racing. 
 
Your catch will fix itself when your body can actually handle what you're asking it to do.
 
Want programs that build thi capacity? Check out SwimStrength membership here.

### 💥 Bulletproofing Shoulder Isn't Real (But This Is Close)

Hey François,
 
Shoulder rebounds look weird.
 
Drop the weight. Snap it back up. Catch it. Reverse it.
 
But here's what's happening:
 
Every muscle in your rotator cuff fires REFLEXIVELY. Perfectly coordinated. Exactly proportional. Completely unconciously.
 
The way they're supposed to work.
 
See how we incorporate these in our programs here.
 
You can't teach that with slow, controlled exercises.
 
Power + strength + shoulder health. One exercise.
 
First time doing them? Your shoulders might feel terrible.
 
After a few months? They'll feel incredible. Primed. Ready to handle anything.
 
I love hitting sprints in the pool right after these.

### 👊 We Always Leave Reps In The Tank

Hey François,
 
Grinding to failure is hardcore, it's cool, looks good on instagram...
 
But it's not for swimmers. 
 
Most of the time on our compound lifts we leave 2-3 reps in the tank.
 
RPE 7-8/10. Never grinding to failure.
 
Why?
 
You're a SWIMMER. Not a powerlifter.
 
Going to failure wrecks your nervous system. You show up to practice feeling fried.
 
But RPE 7-8? That's the sweet spot.
 
See how we implement this in our membership programs here.
 
You get the same benefits with less downsides.
 
Still building strength. Still progressing. But you're FRESH for the pool.
 
Most swimmers don't understand this. They think harder = better.
 
10 years working with thousands of swimmers of all levels taught me: smarter beats harder in the gym.
 
Give yourself some space to always keep progressing. Make it not suck. 
 
SwimStrength membership gives you programs built on getting better AND feeling better day to day.

### 🐬 The Most Powerful Dolphin Kick Exercise

Hey François,
 
Most swimmers never use their hamstrings properly.
 
This is the biggest reason swimmers underwaters suck... It's because they're only using their down-kick, not their up-kick. 
 
The best dolphin kickers in the world have an amazing up-kick - it keeps momentum going and is extra propulsion. 
 
The problem is that most swimmers have a weak up-kick because they can't access their hamstrings and calves together...
 
Foam roller bridges fix this. We use them regularly throughout our membership programs.
 
Impossible to cheat. Your hamstrings and calves HAVE to work together - just like in an dolphin kick.
 
I've had swimmers tell me this fixed their up-kick. First time they'd actually felt their hamstrings doing what they're supposed to naturally.
 
I've used these to help improve underwaters of some of the best dolphin kickers in history - like Chad Le Clos who went the 3rd fastest 200 fly in history after incorporating this exercise in his program. 
 
SwimStrength membership programs only have exercises that we KNOW work, because they've helped thousands

### 🏁 How To Hack Start Power

Hey François,
 
You are way more powerful than you think...
 
You just can't access that power right now because your brain won't let you...
 
For example:
 
Altitude drops look simple.
 
Step off a box. Land. Done.
 
But what's really happening is we're hacking your brain.
 
Btw, we do this in our membership programs here.
 
Your brain won't let you jump 30 inches if it doesn't know you can LAND from 30 inches safely.
 
Safety registered by your brain = your performance ceiling.
 
Altitude drops teach your brain to absorb force quickly. When it knows it can absorb force, it lets you PRODUCE that force.
 
It's a brain hack.
 
Most of what holds you back isn't your muscles. It's your brain.
 
10 years obsessing over what actually works for swimmers taught me this.
 
SwimStrength membership gives you programs built on this science. Not random exercises - systematic progressions of stuff that works for swimmers.

Traditional warm-up: gets you warm. That's it.
 
Neuroprimer: TRAINS your nervous system. Calibrates senses. Improves body awareness and mobility.
 
And it gets BETTER over time.
 
You'll feel better after a month of Neuroprimers than day one.
 
Can't say that about most "get sweaty and a little tired" warm-ups.

Hey François,
 
Big mistake: thinking you need hours in the gym to get stronger.
 
You don't.
 
My workout today? 40 minutes. Neuroprimer. Power. Strength/Mobility. Done.
 
Better results than 90-minute bodybuilding sessions a lot of swimmers waste time on.
 
Why?
 
You don't need MORE time. You need the RIGHT INTENTION, and PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD.
 
One quality set beats five grindy ones.
 
I've spent 10 years figuring out what transfers to the pool. Olympians, masters, age-groupers - thousands of athletes.
 
What works best across the board: 45 minutes, 2-3 times per week. Focused. Intentional. Recording what matters.

### 🚫 Stop "Grinding" in the gym

Hey François,
 
Most swimmers think strength training should feel like a pool grind.
 
Exhausted. Destroyed. Barely able to walk out.
 
That means good stuff is happening...right?
 
Wrong.
 
Building raw strength targets your NERVOUS SYSTEM above all.
 
This is how we target it to stay fresh.
 
You should leave feeling ACTIVATED. Ready to go. Not dragging yourself to practice.
 
When I tell swimmers to train at RPE 7-8 (leaving 2-3 reps in the tank), they think I'm soft.
 
"That doesn't feel hard enough."
 
Good. It's not supposed to.
 
I've worked with thousands of swimmers over 10 years. The ones who get this? They get faster.

"Jake, you should be doing those with a high elbow so they're swimming-specific."
 
That's exactly why I DON'T.
 
You already do that pattern thousands of times per week in the pool. Why overwork it more in the gym?
 
The gym's job: give your body what it's NOT getting in the pool.
 
General strength. Raw power. Different movement patterns. 
 
We do this Here.
 
I've spent 10 years working with swimmers from age-group to Olympians like Chad Le Clos and Max Litchfield.
 
The swimmers who try to make everything "swimming-specific" in the gym? They stay weak and usually end up injured.
 
The swimmers who build GENERAL strength and power? They become better athletes and end up hitting PBs.
 
SwimStrength membership gives you programs that actually understand this. Complete training programs in our app.
 
No BS. Just what works.
 
Jake

### ▶️ Your Training Isn't Designed For YOU

Hey François,
 
Ever wonder why some programs work great for some people - but suck for others?
 
This is something most swim coaches don't understand...
 
They think everyone should respond to their programs the same - if you're not swimming fast then you're the problem. 
 
You don't sleep enough, you don't eat properly, you don't train hard enough. 
 
Neurotyping calls bulls**t on that. (▶️ watch the video here)
 
It gives us answers as to why some people do great on high volume programs, why some people do great on low volume programs. Why some people are motivated by winning and other are motivated by pleasing others and doing a good job for their team.
 
It gives us the insights we need to guide and individualise our training, recovery, and create programs that motivate us. 
 
You probably can't do much about your swim program - but you can optimise what you're doing in the gym and give your body a solid dose of what it needs to perform properly!
 
Our Elite Program gives you what your body craves and does best on.

### Lift less. Get stronger. (Yes, really.)

Hey François,
 
You don't need more volume. You need the right stimulus.
 
But I watch swimmers try to out-work their weakness every damn day. Longer workouts, extra sets, more accessories. 
 
You know what that builds? 
 
Fatigue. 
 
Not strength.
 
Here's what we do instead: Join a membership here
2-3 sessions × 45 min (that's it, seriously) 
Full-range strength that actually transfers to the pool 
Enough rest to lift HEAVY and still crush practice 
The result? You get stronger, more powerful, faster – without feeling like death.
 
Look, I know it sounds backwards. Everyone else is grinding 90-minute sessions and you're gonna do LESS?
 
Yeah. Because when you're not buried in fatigue, you can actually create the stimulus that makes you stronger. Weird how that works.
 
Lift less. Get stronger. Swim faster.
 
It's literally that simple when you stop trying to prove how hard you can work and start training like you have a brain.
 
Want the exact blueprint?

### Elite Catch Positions Don't Come From Technique Work

Hey François,
 
Watch this video for the full breakdown: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQdemzlsGzM
 
Your catch isn't a technique problem.
 
I know that sounds insane because you've spent years doing drills, sculling, and working on that high elbow.
 
But here's the thing...
 
You already know what a good catch looks like.
 
You just physically can't do it when you're tired.
 
Most swimmers are trying to fix their catch with more technique work when their body literally doesn't have the mobility to even get into the position.
 
Or the strength to hold it.
 
Or the capacity to maintain it when the acid builds up at the end of the race.
 
That's not a technique issue.
 
That's a body that's not prepared to do what your brain already knows.
 
And no amount of sculling is going to fix that.
 
Watch the video to make sense of this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQdemzlsGzM

### NEVER gym AFTER you swim

Hey François,
 
If you're dragging yourself to the gym after swimming - you know, that whole "might as well since I'm already here" thing - you're completely wasting your time.
 
Your nervous system is cooked. Your energy is shot. You're just moving weight around with zero intent, zero explosiveness, zero anything that actually matters.
 
Basically, you're getting tired without getting better. Cool strategy.
 
Here's what we do instead:
 
Short, powerful, precise sessions - but here's the catch: you have to actually be FRESH for them to work. That's why we lift before swimming. Always.
 
And before you freak out about being tired for practice, listen...
 
When you lift first (and do it right), you get this thing called post-activation potentiation. Fancy way of saying you actually feel BETTER in the water. More switched on. More connected. More explosive.
 
It's like your nervous system wakes up instead of shutting down.
 
So yeah, if you're still doing those sad, post-practice gym sessions where you half-ass some bench and curls... maybe stop?
 
Do it in the right order, do you gym sessions properly, and both your gym AND swim sessions get better. Wild concept, I know.

### The less "dryland" you do - the stronger you'll get

Hey François,
 
Traditional dryland is killing your gains. 
 
That not just a controversial opinion - it's what I have seen with thousands of swimmers over the years. 
 
Stop dryland - replace it with minimalistic strength training - get stronger and faster and feel better EVERYTIME. 
 
Dryland is something swim coaches give you when they know you should be doing stuff outside the pool but they don't actually know what - so they put together random circuits of exercises to babysit you. That's where this started. 
 
I don't just think it's bad - I think it's malpractice - leave the land training to the land-training experts - just like we leave brain surgery to the brain surgeons.
 
I've seen too many swimmers get hurt and get stuck in plateaus on these programs to stay quiet about it. 
 
If you're not really bothered about swimming fast - any information I give you will be useless and just make you uncomfortable, please unsubscribe from these emails at the button at the bottom of this email. 
 
If you ARE serious about swimming fast - you can't be training like a 10 year old in babysitter circuits - it is slowing you down and you won't understand how much until you start doing things properly.

### Scared you'll get INJURED lifting?

Hey François,
 
I get it.
 
Most swimmers are terrified of heavy lifting because they think they're gonna get hurt. And honestly? With most mainstream programs combined with swimming, they probably would.
 
That's why we have so many injuries in such a low impact sport.
 
Because most people have no idea what they're doing.
 
They go balls to the wall, max out everything, and completely ignore all the stuff that actually keeps you healthy. 
 
OR they do too little and never actually build joint tolerance so they become fragile.
 
That's not what we're doing in the Elite Program.
 
Yeah, we lift heavy. But we're not maxing out like some powerlifter. And it's all completely relative to where you are today. 
 
You add 1% onto the bar each week, staying away from failure. That's not going to hurt you. But it can get you very strong whilst feeling good.
 
We use exercises and methods that build real strength and power while keeping your joints happy. Low volume, high intent - just enough to get stronger without nuking your recovery for the next three days.
 
But here's the part most people miss: we actually train joint health because it's one of the biggest things that will hold you back as a masters swimmer. 
 
We're building tissue tolerance right alongside strength, so your body gets MORE resilient every phase, not less.
 
That's why our swimmers don't just get stronger - they actually feel better, so they can push harder in the pool. 
 
And when you match all this with your neurotype? Boom, you're sorted. 
 
You adapt faster, feel fresher, perform better - both in the gym and the pool.
 
👉Join the Elite Program and see how lifting heavy (the RIGHT way) can actually make your body feel better than it has in years.

P.S. If you join today I'll throw in the Full Mobility Bundle for FREE - so you can focus in on specific areas you're struggling with alongside your main program. I will only honour this deal 24 hours after sending this email.

### TRAIN HARD, GO SLOW

Hey François,
 
Ugh, this one hits home.
 
You're showing up to practice. Doing every set. Following the program to the letter. And somehow... nothing's changing. Maybe your times are even getting worse?
 
Meanwhile you're exhausted ALL the time. Everything feels heavy. You're dragging yourself to the pool thinking "what's wrong with me?"
 
Here's the thing - nothing's wrong with you. You're just cooked.
 
And doing more isn't going to fix it. Trust me, I've watched so many people try to dig themselves out of this hole by digging harder. Spoiler: it doesn't work.
 
The problem is that most of us get handed the same cookie-cutter workouts. Same yardage, same intervals, same "just push through it" advice. As if we all respond to training the exact same way.
 
[Join the Elite Membership here to fix it]
 
But your brain chemistry - your neurotype - that's what actually determines how you adapt to training. Feed it the wrong type of stress and you're not building fitness, you're just breaking down.
 
When you figure out what YOUR nervous system actually needs? Game changer.
 
Suddenly you're not dragging anymore. Recovery actually happens, lol. You show up to practice and - weird concept - you actually WANT to be there. The water feels good again.
 
That's the whole deal with the Elite Program. We figure out your neurotype and build your training around how YOUR brain and body actually work.
 
It's not about being tougher or pushing through more pain. It's about finally training in a way that makes sense for YOU.
 
If you're tired of feeling like you're fighting your own body every day, maybe it's time to try something that actually works with how you're wired 
 
Check out the Elite Program and see what training's like when it's actually designed for your nervous system.

### Stop copying bodybuilders if you want to get fast

Hey François,
 
Here’s why most swimmers waste time in the gym:
 They train like bodybuilders - high reps, isolation, pump work - thinking that’s what “strength training” means.
 
But swimming strength anc speed isn’t built on pump.
 It’s about how efficient your nervous system is at expressing force quickly in specific positions.
 
The Momentum Membership strips away all the fluff and focuses on what actually transfers: – Explosive lifts for starts, turns and sprints. – Mobility to maximise technique – Strength work that leaves you activated not drained
 
The result?
 More power in the water and less fatigue after training.
 
You don’t need two-hour gym sessions or fancy machines.
 You just need the right methods, done consistently.
 
That’s exactly what you’ll experience inside Momentum - 👉 and you can test it free for 7 days.👈 
No wasted time. No soreness that ruins your next swim.
 Just results that show up where it matters - in the pool and in competitions.

### You're not lazy - you're overtrained

Hey François,
 
If you’ve ever wondered, “Why am I not seeing results in competition - I'm training so hard?” 
 
You’re not broken. You’re overtrained.
 
Most swim programs push intensity or volume every day - threshold sets, best-average, or just endless mindless garbage yardage. 
 But your body doesn’t adapt when it’s constantly overloaded - it just survives.
 
When I started programming like a scientist instead of a grinder, everything changed.
 My swimmers stopped feeling wrecked after every week.
 They started recovering faster, hitting better times, and finally seeing the speed they’d been chasing.
 
The secret?
 Short, focused gym sessions that are designed for speed - not grunt work.
 
That’s what you get in the Momentum Membership  
2-3 swimmer-specific workouts a week that build strength, power, and mobility while keeping you fresh for the pool.
 
If you’ve been feeling stuck or exhausted, 👉try it for free for 7 days.

### Train less to get faster

Hey François,
 
Most swimmers think, “I need to train more if I want to get faster.”
 
That’s what so many coaches preach.
 More yardage. More grind. More pain.
 
But here’s what actually happens when you keep piling it on:
 Your nervous system burns out.
 Your power drops.
 And you stop adapting for speed - you turn into a work horse and not a racehorse.
 
Here’s the truth:
 You don’t need more training. You need the right kind of stimulus that makes your body stronger and lets it recover.
 
That’s exactly what the Momentum Membership does.
 It’s minimalist strength training built for swimmers - 
 2-3 short, high-impact sessions per week that increase your strength, speed, and mobility without draining you for the pool.
 
Swimmers in Momentum are swimming faster with less total training time.
 You can try it free for 7 days - no risk, just results.

If you start this now, you’ll be years ahead by the time you get to university.
 
Most teenage swimmers wait until they plateau to start gym training.
 By then, it’s harder to fix the gaps - and takes longer.
 
If I was starting over, I’d start at 10-12 years old with low volume sessions that don't take too long or make you tired for the rest of your life - but build a solid foundation of strength, mobility and coordination that sets you up for the best career possible in siwmming.
 
That’s what the Momentum Membership is built for.
 2-3 short, bang-for-your-buck swimmer-focused sessions a week.
 Strength, power, and mobility that keep you fresh while setting you up for long-term speed.
 
The later you start - the less change you have of reaching your life-long goals in this sport.

### They're wasting your time

Hey François,
 
They’re wasting your time.
 
You’ve been told to “just lift heavy weights” or “do more dryland circuits”… and it’s costing you.
 
You’ve probably heard things like:
 “Follow a push/pull/legs split.”
 “Grind through random circuits.”
 “Skip dryland altogether - just swim more.”
 
But here’s the problem:
 1. None of that transfers to faster swimming. 2. It leaves you too drained to actually perform in the pool. 3. It kills your confidence because you’re guessing instead of following a system.
 
My swimmers?
 They crushed PBs regularly following our short workouts - some even dropping 10+ seconds in their 200s within a couple months of starting.
 
Because we get strong faster, whilst doing less - with methods that actually transfer to speed in the pool.

Switches your nervous system on so your body feels ready to perform and your brain becomes "spongy to speed up learning new skills. 
Frees up stiffness in your spine and joints so you move smoother in the water.  
Boosts recovery by stimulating the lymphatic system and clearing toxins. 
Sharpens focus and coordination with eye drills that connect your brain and body.

### Dumb stuff swim coaches do

Hey François,
 
Most swim coaches don’t understand land training.
 
And that’s not me being harsh - it’s just the truth.
 
What they usually give you isn’t strength training. It’s not power training. It’s not mobility training.
 
It’s what I call babysitter workouts.
 
Circuits. Burpees. Crunches. Push-ups until your arms give out.
 
The goal isn’t to make you faster - it’s just to keep you busy and feeling tired.
 
Here’s the problem:
Swimming already gives you more than enough fatigue. 
Babysitter workouts add even more junk volume on top. 
You end up slower, stiffer, and more drained in the pool. 
The opposite of what you actually need.
 
Real land training for swimmers should be:
Full-body strength sessions, 3 times a week 
Enough intensity to build power, not endless reps for a burn 
Designed to leave you fresher in the pool, not wrecked on deck 
That’s the approach we use in our Momentum program.
 
And if you’ve been stuck doing babysitter workouts, you can test the difference for yourself - with a free 7-day trial.

### Bodyweight vs Gym

Hey François,
 
Let me be blunt about something most swimmers won't admit...
 
Bodyweight workouts just don't work as well.
 
Sure, they're convenient. You can do them at home in your pajamas. No commute. No gym membership.
 
But here's what you're sacrificing:
 
Variety that actually matters. In the gym, you have endless exercise options. Dumbbells, barbells, machines, cables - each tool challenges your body differently. This variety keeps your nervous system engaged and your progress consistent through every phase.
 
Bodyweight? You're stuck with the same handful of movements forever. Your body adapts fast, then you plateau hard due to lack of brain engagement.
 
Real hormonal stimulus. Heavy weights create a massive hormonal response - growth hormone, testosterone, all the good stuff that builds strength and power. Bodyweight squats? Not so much.
 
It's like comparing a firecracker to dynamite. Both make noise, but only one creates real change.
 
Ready to stop limiting yourself with bodyweight workouts? 
 
Try our Momentum free trial - 3 sessions per week, 45-60 minutes each, designed to get you strong and fast in the pool using real gym equipment.
 
But here's the game-changer most people miss: mindset.
 
When you walk into a gym, your brain shifts into athlete mode. You're surrounded by serious equipment, focused people, and an environment built for performance.
 
Compare that to doing pushups in your living room while your dog watches Netflix.
 
Your environment shapes your effort. And your effort shapes your results.
 
The gym forces you to show up differently. To think bigger. To push harder than you ever would in your spare bedroom.
 
That mental shift alone is worth the price of admission.
 
Stop settling for convenient mediocrity. 
 
Start your free Momentum trial today and discover what happens when you train in an environment designed to make you faster, stronger, and more powerful than bodyweight workouts ever could.

### Feeling good is better than grinding (neurotype truth)

Hey François,
Training should be fun.
Or at least not suck.
I know that sounds soft. Like you're not "serious" about swimming.
But here's the truth: the more sessions you can string together where you feel fresh, the better each session is going to be.
And the more fun you'll have.
We don't push you to the point of breaking. We do as little as possible to get better, then make sure you come back fresh for the next session.
Because fresh sessions are quality sessions. And quality sessions compound.
When you feel good walking into practice, you can actually work on technique. You can hit your target times. You can push when it matters.
When you feel destroyed, you're just surviving.
Take our neurotype quiz for free, then get 3 weeks of training designed specifically for your type.
But here's what most coaches miss: different neurotypes respond completely differently to training stress.
Type 1A swimmers burn out fast and need more recovery between higher volume sessions - but can do short very intense sessions every day.
Type 3 swimmers handle consistent high volume well but crash from too much intensity. They need predictable progression to stay feeling good.
Type 2B swimmers need emotional connection and mind muscle connection. Grinding actually works for these guys. 
Most programs ignore this and wonder why half their swimmers plateau or quit.
Your neurotype determines what makes training fun vs. what makes it suck.
When you train according to your wiring, sessions feel challenging but doable. You leave practice tired but satisfied, not destroyed.
When you train against your neurotype, every session feels like a grind. You start dreading practice instead of looking forward to it.
Take our neurotype quiz for free, then get 3 weeks of training designed specifically for your type.
The swimmers who keep improving year after year? They've figured out how to make training sustainable and enjoyable.
Not easy. Enjoyable.
There's a huge difference.
Easy training doesn't make you better. But training that constantly breaks you down doesn't either.
The sweet spot is training that challenges you while keeping you fresh enough to come back and do it again tomorrow.
And the day after that. And the day after that.
That's how you build a career, not just survive a season.

### Are You Using the Neuroprimer?

Hey François,
Here’s something I don’t understand…
All swimmers want to get faster. 
What I’ve sent you is completely free. 
If you use it, it will work. 
So why do so many swimmers sign up but never use it?
Here’s what happens:
1 in 4 swimmers who visit the page don’t sign up. 
Of those who do, less than half ever open the PDFs. 
Of those who do, only a third check out the Neuro-Primer—and most don’t even finish it. 
So if you are using the Neuro-Primer, congratulations! You’re already ahead of most swimmers just by taking action.
But…
If you haven’t started yet, your competition might be getting ahead of you. 
Don’t make this mistake:
Just because these resources are FREE doesn’t mean they aren’t valuable.
If you use them, they will make you a better swimmer—it’s that simple.
So don’t give your rivals an easy win. It’s not too late—start using the Neuro-Primer today and get ahead!
But if you don’t want to get faster or beat your competition, feel free to ignore this.
As always, it’s your choice.
Jake

### How many Dryland Sessions?

Hey François,
If you want to get faster, the best number of strength workouts per week is three.
This is just enough to help you get stronger without messing up your swim training.
That’s why almost every SwimStrength membership includes 3 workouts a week. (Except for Jacked Speed, which has 4 because it also builds muscle!)
How long are the workouts?
Most last about 45-60 minutes (some are a little different based on neurotype).
If you’re short on time, 30-minute workouts can still work really well.
The most important thing is doing 3 sessions per week, even if they’re shorter.
3 x 30-minute sessions is better than 2 x 45-minute sessions—even though the total time is the same!
It always feels like we don’t have time. But if swimming really matters to you, you can find just 1.5 hours per week by:
Spending less time on your phone
Watching one less TV episode
Playing a little less video games
If getting faster is important, make time for it.
If it isn’t, why are you reading this?
Your success is your choice.

### Dryland Workout Variety

Hey François,
If you’re trying to figure out dryland training on your own, here’s a great question from the SwimStrength community:
Question:
Should I change my dryland workouts?
Should every workout be different?
Should I do the same workout for a few weeks, then change?
Should I do the same workout forever?
Answer:
In our memberships, we change some exercises every 3 weeks. This keeps training fun and helps swimmers keep improving.
How much we change depends on your neurotype. Some swimmers like to repeat workouts, while others need variety to stay motivated.
Why does this work?
You’re not training to be a weightlifter—you’re training to be a faster swimmer.
If you never change exercises, you only get good at lifting weights, not swimming.
If you change too often, you won’t know if you’re getting stronger.
In our membership, swimmers get better every session because the plan helps them train the right way.
If you train on your own, make sure to change your workouts every few weeks—but not too often. The goal isn’t just lifting weights. It’s getting stronger so you can swim faster.
Best, Jake
P.S. I’ll take care of all this for you when you join the SwimStrength Membership here!

### Will you ever drop time again?

Hey François,
Let’s talk about why swimmers stop getting faster and hit a plateau.
Today’s reason: diminishing returns.
There are times when swimming feels easy—you get faster every race!
But then, suddenly… you stop improving. And that feels really frustrating.
This happens because:
You were growing
You were getting stronger
Your technique was improving
You had more training
But this doesn’t last forever.
At some point:
You stop growing as fast
You stop getting stronger automatically
Your technique is already good
This is called diminishing returns—you have to work way harder to get small improvements.
Even the fastest swimmers in the world can’t drop seconds off their times like they did when they were kids.
So if you’re stuck, you need to change something:  
Get a new coach
Change your training
Do a better dryland program
For most swimmers—even the best ones—the missing piece is strength training made for swimmers.
The problem? - Most swim coaches don’t understand strength training. - Most strength coaches don’t understand swimming.
That’s why I made this membership—to help swimmers get stronger, faster, and better.
Join SwimStrength here! 
Or… stay where you are.
In my next email, I’ll talk about another reason swimmers stop improving.
See you soon, Jake

### Dryland - Before or After Swim Training?

Hi François,
"Should I do dryland before or after my swim training?".
This is a question I get asked a lot…and the answer is really simple.
If you train how we do in our memberships - training before will improve your swim session. Training after will usually just make your land training session worse.
However if you don't know what you're doing with your land training you can throw this advice out. Most land training programs just make you tired and not much faster. The swim world is waaay behind on training swimmers on land. 
Lucky for you I have a membership to take care of that! Check it out at this link: Join the Swimstrength membership

### What We Do at SwimStrength

Hi François,
I started SwimStrength because I wanted to help as many swimmers as possible. That’s why I stopped coaching just one team. Now, I can help swimmers all over the world!
How do I help?
If you’re reading this, you’ve probably seen my Instagram, where I share free tips about strength training for swimmers.
I can give out free advice because of the training programs I offer:
Monthly Strength Training Membership (Workouts sent through the Train Heroic app)
Every membership comes with free access to the SwimStrength Community. This is where we share wins and hold each other accountable.
Want to see which program is right for you? When you sign up for the membership we'll give you a test to help you figure out exactly where to start based on your goals! 
Talk soon, Jake

### Dryland training doesn't work...

Hey François,
If you've ever felt like your dryland training wasn’t delivering the results you hoped for, you’re not alone. The problem isn’t you—it’s the traditional dryland approach.
Dryland training often focuses on high reps and endurance, leaving you exhausted but not necessarily faster. What swimmers really need is proper strength training—methods that develop power and speed in the water. No, powerlifting or bodybuilding aren't good either - but we'll get to that later…
Here’s the truth: strength training for swimmers isn’t about grinding through endless reps. It’s about doing the right exercises with precision, focusing on full-body movements, and managing fatigue. 
IN FACT, we actually encourage our members to STOP doing their current dryland sessions if possible - because those that do see a big boost in their performance simply by REMOVING something that was just interfering with their recovery and not making them a better athlete. 
In this video, I explain how you can train smarter and see massive improvements: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEXBWeB8F3Q&t=251s 
Our mission is to get swimmers around the world starting to Strength Train properly and efficiently. Our training is simple, effective, and gets results. 
If you can figure the land side of things out, you are in for MASSIVE gains in the pool!
Stop grinding and start thriving,
Jake 
SwimStrength
